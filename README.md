## My process

I started with the container, then built it out from there.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that sizing of the image needed told to be 100% of the container, and without specifying this it will default to the size of the image and overflow the container. I also learned that align-text needs to be in the container and not within the h1 or p elements.

### Continued development

I will continue to learn how to work with containers and how they interact with other elements within them, such as sizing, wrapping, and alignment.

### Useful resources

I relied on Google a lot and found several people posing the same question. However, getting to the correct solution was not easy as a lot of responses suggested things like object-fit, display:block, and other things. The width: 100% seems to be the best solution, but I am looking forward to feedback on whether it was.
